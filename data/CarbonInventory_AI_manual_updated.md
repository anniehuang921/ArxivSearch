# Instruction Manual: Keyword Guidance for AI-based Carbon Inventory Search

## üéØ Purpose

This manual is designed to assist AI agents by providing **keyword-level guidance** for conducting academic paper searches related to **carbon inventory (Á¢≥Áõ§Êü•)**, **carbon footprint analysis**, and **GHG emission tracking** using **AI or machine learning** techniques.

It is intended to be used **in combination with another manual that provides operational steps**, such as arXiv's search interface guide.

## üîç Recommended Keywords and Concepts

The following terms are semantically related to tasks involving carbon inventory, carbon accounting, and emissions tracking:

### Primary Keywords
- "carbon inventory"
- "carbon accounting"
- "carbon footprint analysis"
- "GHG reporting"
- "greenhouse gas estimation"

### AI + Environmental Synergy
- "AI for carbon management"
- "machine learning carbon footprint"
- "sustainable AI"
- "AI energy optimization"
- "AI for environmental impact"

### Related Industrial Topics
- "sustainable supply chain"
- "carbon audit"
- "emissions control in factories"

Agents may use combinations of these terms to improve retrieval relevance when searching academic databases like arXiv.

Use the keyword combination: "carbon footprint" AND "AI", with quotation marks included to ensure phrase-level search in arXiv.

### Example Search Queries with Correct Quotation Use

When forming search queries, combine key terms with quotation marks and logical connectors. For example:

- "GHG emission" AND "AI"
- "carbon footprint" AND "machine learning"
- "carbon accounting" AND "deep learning"
- "greenhouse gas estimation" AND "AI"

## ü§ñ How Agents Should Use This Manual (via RAG)

When answering queries such as:

> ‚ÄúFind recent AI papers about carbon inventory‚Äù

The agent should:
1. Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch keyword suggestions from this manual
2. Pair these terms with the **operational instructions provided by the arXiv manual**
3. Formulate precise search queries (e.g., "GHG emission" AND "AI")
4. Pass those queries to the search interface
5. Report results in response to the user's original query
